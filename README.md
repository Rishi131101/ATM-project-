 This Java ATM project provides a simple console-based interface for basic banking tasks like checking balance, depositing, withdrawing money, and exiting after PIN verification. It uses conditional logic, loops, and the Scanner class to handle user input, making it a neat beginner-friendly example of interactive Java programming.
