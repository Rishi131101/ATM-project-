This simple ATM project in Java demonstrates a console-based banking interface that allows users to access core financial operations after PIN authentication. It supports checking the account balance, depositing funds, withdrawing money (with sufficient balance check), and exiting the session. The program uses conditional logic, looping constructs, and the Scanner class to handle dynamic user input and display options. It’s a clean implementation that introduces essential concepts like input validation, switch-case decision structures, and basic account management—ideal for beginners exploring Java application development.
